# INTRODUCTION
  ## [CSS Good Practices: Reflection and Warning]()

  ### What is a good practice?

Good practices are a set of customs, actions, decisions, and/or tools that streamline, improve performance, readability, maintenance, and/or scalability of our projects in a very specific CONTEXT.

The keyword is context. Good practices are NOT absolute. Just as they work in certain situations, they may not make sense in other circumstances.

It is a common mistake to talk about good or bad practices without understanding their context correctly.

<br>

  ### The context of this course

The Practical Frontend Developer Course belongs to two schools in Platzi:

  * The JavaScript professional route: it is the shortest route to learn web development from scratch to a very advanced level with the PERNN Stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Next.js, and Node.js).

  * Web Development School: the longest and most complete learning path to master and delve into all the most important programming tools or stacks of web development.
ðŸ’¡ JavaScript School vs. Web Development School: Which one to choose? Which one is better?

Along with the Frontend Developer Course, this course is the introduction to the great world of HTML and CSS layout that we will study in the JavaScript School. After this course, we will continue with the basics of JavaScript, frontend with React.js, and backend with Node.js.

In contrast, in the Web Development School, we have many more courses to practice HTML and CSS, create even more projects for your professional portfolio, and delve into complex tools such as responsive design, CSS Grid, flexbox, and CSS animations.

<br>

  ### Style tag vs. .css files

In the next classes, you may wonder why we decided not to separate the styles into their own .css files if it is supposedly a "bad practice." But remember that good or bad practices are NOT absolute, they always depend on a context.

Later on your learning path, you will take the Practical React.js Course. One of its objectives is to teach you how to convert pages in HTML and CSS to components in React. You will realize that there we download the project from this Frontend Developer Practical Course to separate it into views, components, and containers.

The reason for keeping the HTML and CSS of each section of our store in a single .html file is to facilitate our work of separating and joining all that code when we take the React course.

<br>

  ### Conclusions

If your project with HTML and CSS is the final version of the application that you will deploy to production (the one you will publish on the internet and will be used by real users), then it is definitely a very good practice to separate your styles into .css files.

On the other hand, if your layout with HTML and CSS is just the beginning of your frontend development and later you will convert these elements into components with a tool like Web Components, React.js, Angular, Svelte, or Vue.js, then it is NOT a bad practice to separate each element into its respective file or keep its HTML and CSS in the same place.

I hope this explanation has helped you understand a little about the development flow and decisions we made in this course. Always remember to have a very clear understanding of the context of each situation before determining if it is a good or bad practice.

# LAYOUT AND COMPONENTS
  ## [Identify your Project Screens]()
Web layout or web design consists of transforming a graphic design â€”a sketchâ€” (made by UX/UI in Figma or Sketch) into a functional interface in terms of programming that a specific browser or device understands.

</p>

The design area provided us with the project sketch in Figma.
We can identify the views of:

  * Home
  * Account creation
  * Access
  * Shopping cart
  * Purchase order
  * Product detail
  * Menu

</p>

From here, you can see how the interaction between the different screens works.
